### Task Time Tracker
I wanted a simple terminal count down timer, No sounds, no noise Just desktop notifications. So I created this one

### How to use it

- Run `cargo build --release` & use/open the `binary/executable` file
- When you see the `rdy_>` sign on your terminal, this means it is working
- Write the track command to start counting down in minutes
- `track 10 minutes` , This for example will count down for 10 minutes
- `track 10 seconds` , This for example will count down for 10 seconds
- Once it is done, You will receive a notification on your desktop
- If you wanna close it just write `exit`

### Note
- I'm still learning RUST, I love it & I'm sure there is a better code for the same functionality, I'm getting there ...
